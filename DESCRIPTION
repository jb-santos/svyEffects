Description: Calculates marginal effects for limited dependent variable models
  estimated on survey-weighted data using both the "average marginal effects" 
  approach (a.k.a. marginal effects at observed values) and the "marginal effects
  at reasonable/representative/typical values" approach (a.k.a. the effect for
  the "average case"). Uses simulation-based methods (parametric bootstrapping) 
  to derive confidence intervals. It is compatible with survey-weighted models 
  of the classes \code{survey::svyglm}, \code{survey::svyolr}, and 
  \code{svrepmisc::svymultinom}.
